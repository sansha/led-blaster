# led-blaster

project inspired by pi-blaster and based on xyz (noch einf√ºgen!!) libary.

the goal is to create a universal code in which you write settings and so on in a FIFO style (just like pi-blaster).
the following things are on our toDo-list:
1 assign pins to led colors (i.e. 17 = blue led)
2 enter desired fade mode (linear, exp., no fade)
3 enter target brigthness for each led/for all rgbw leds (the program will then fade according to the fade mode
4 option to connect an sound sensor 
5 some additional modes like continious fade to random color w/ defined speed etc.
6 an alarm clock which fades on all/some leds slowly at a given time (sun simulation to wake up easily)
7 more to come...


still much work to do, right now the fifo interface is in development, with cli 2 & 3 are currently working.
